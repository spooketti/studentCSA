<h1>Welcome to my AP Computer Science Applications Portfolio!</h1>
<p>I am Jonathan Liu, a junior in high school and this is my website for my AP CSA class. On this website you will find my projects, write-ups, and much more to come! I am interested in computer science, game development, 3D modeling and cadding, eletrical engineering with Arduino, and much more.</p>

<h1>My Passions</h1>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I love playing guitar! I play mainly electric and acoustic guitar in my free time, all self-taught and try to write music in my spare time. Here are some recordings of two of my favorite pieces on guitar, ゆらゆら by YeYe, and 青葉市子 by Ichiko Aoba.</p>

<p>I am currently writing a song, so stay tuned for that.
I also started off in life playing piano, but never went further than sixth grade as I decided to focus on computer science instead!
Sometimes I think about what life would be like if I never gave it up, but I also wouldn't give up anything in the world for the life I have now. </p>
