    "\n",
    "In Java, evaluating conditions and controlling the flow of your program is fundamental. This involves using boolean expressions and operators, as well as conditional statements like if, if-else, and else if. These constructs help you make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on varying conditions. Understanding how to use these effectively is crucial for writing clear and efficient code."

    "## Boolean Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boolean expressions** evaluate to either **true** or **false** and use the following operators:\n",
    "- `==` (equals to)\n",
    "- `!=` (not equal to)\n",
    "- `<` (less than)\n",
    "- `<=` (less than or equal to)\n",
    "- `>` (greater than)\n",
    "- `>=` (greater than or equal to)\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators compare **primitive types** like integers and doubles. For example:\n",
    "- `3 < 5` returns **true**\n",
    "- `3 >= 5` returns **false**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boolean Logic Operators** include:\n",
    "- **! (NOT)**: Negates the expression. Example: `!true` evaluates to `false`.\n",
    "- **&& (AND)**: Returns true if both expressions are true. Example: `(a % 2 == 0) && (a % 3 == 0)` is true if `a` is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n",
    "- **&#124;&#124; (OR)**: Returns true if at least one expression is true. Example: `(a % 2 == 0) || (a % 3 == 0)` is true if `a` is divisible by either 2 or 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order of Operations**:\n",
    "1. NOT\n",
    "2. AND\n",

    "## Comparing Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, to compare objects for equality, you should understand the differences between the `==` operator and the `equals()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equality Operator (`==`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `==` operator checks if two references point to the exact same object in memory. It does not compare the values or attributes of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String a = \"Hi\";\n",
    "String b = \"Hi\";\n",
    "String c = a;\n",
    "String d = new String(\"Hi\");\n",
    "\n",
    "System.out.println(a == c); // true (same reference)\n",
    "System.out.println(a == b); // true (interned string literals)\n",
    "System.out.println(a == d); // false (different references)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `equals()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `equals()` method compares the values or attributes of two objects. It is often overridden in custom classes to provide meaningful equality checks based on the class's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String a = \"Hi\";\n",
    "String b = \"Hi\";\n",
    "String d = new String(\"Hi\");\n",
    "\n",
    "System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true (same content)\n",
    "System.out.println(a.equals(d)); // true (same content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **`==` Operator**: Checks reference equality. Use it to see if two references point to the same object.\n",
    "- **`equals()` Method**: Checks value equality. Use it to compare the contents of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing objects, use `equals()` unless you need to check if the references are the same instance. Understanding these methods helps in writing accurate and effective Java code."
