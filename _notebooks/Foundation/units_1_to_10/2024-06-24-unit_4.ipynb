    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are fundamental constructs in programming that allow for the repetition of code. They are essential for performing tasks that require iteration, such as processing elements in arrays or strings, and executing repetitive actions. In this guide, we'll explore various types of loops—while loops, for loops—and their applications, including how they interact with strings and nested structures. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing efficient algorithms and solving complex problems in programming."

    "## While Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. The condition is evaluated before each iteration, and if it is true, the loop's body runs; if false, the loop terminates. To avoid infinite loops, ensure the condition will eventually become false by modifying it within the loop.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1. Initialize `i` to 0.\n",
    "2. The loop checks if `i` is less than 5. If true, it executes the body.\n",
    "3. The body prints `i` and increments it.\n",
    "4. After each iteration, the condition is re-evaluated. When `i` reaches 5, the loop stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tracing Table:**\n",
    "| i | Output |\n",
    "|-|-|\n",
    "| 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 | 2 |\n",
    "| 3 | 3 |\n",
    "| 4 | 4 |\n",
    "\n",
    "If the initial condition is false, the loop will not execute. A `return` statement inside a while loop will also stop it immediately, regardless of the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Uses:**\n",
    "- Identify individual digits of an integer\n",
    "- Determine a minimum or maximum value\n",

    "## For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop provides a concise way to repeat code with initialization, condition-checking, and iteration all in one line. The basic structure in Java is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (initialization; condition; iteration) {\n",
    "    // code to be executed\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Executes once before the loop starts, typically to set up a loop counter.\n",
    "- **Condition**: Evaluated before each iteration. If true, the loop body executes; if false, the loop terminates.\n",
    "- **Iteration**: Executes after each iteration of the loop body, usually to update the loop counter.\n",

    "}"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "1. `int i = 0;` initializes the loop counter `i`.\n",
    "2. `i < 5` is the condition. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than 5.\n",
    "3. `i++` increments `i` after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop achieves the same result as a while loop but in fewer lines, making it more compact and often easier to read. All for loops can be converted to while loops and vice versa."

    "2. `int count = 0;` creates a counter for occurrences of \"e\".\n",
    "3. `for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++)` iterates over each character in the string.\n",
    "4. `str.substring(i, i+1).equals(\"e\")` checks if the current character is \"e\".\n",
    "5. If true, increment the count.\n",
