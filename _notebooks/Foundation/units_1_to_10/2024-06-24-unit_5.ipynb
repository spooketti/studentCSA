    "A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects in programming. It encapsulates data and methods that operate on that data. To define a class, specify its access level (public or private), use the `class` keyword, and provide a name. Inside the class, you define variables to hold data and methods to perform operations. For instance, in the `AreaCalculator` class, you can define instance variables and methods to calculate areas of various shapes, illustrating how classes structure and manage data and functionality."
