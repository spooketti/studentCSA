This means when you run Sass code, you're actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser.\n",

    "## What is CSS\n",
    "- CSS is the default technology that most programmers use when styling webpages. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, CSS is not very easy to work with lacking a lot features often making using CSS very confusing and difficult or hard to work with on lengthy projects. This is why there are tools like Bootstrap, Sass, and Tailwind that make styling a lot easier and more efficient. We will be using Sass in this course.  \n",

    "### So which one is better to use?\n",

    "## Benefits Of SASS Over Traditional CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improved Code Organization\n",
    "- **Nesting Capabilities**: SASS allows you to nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.\n",
    "- **Modular Approach**: You can split your CSS into multiple files (partials) and import them into a main file, making your project more organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintainability\n",
    "- **Use of Variables**: Define colors, fonts, and other CSS values as variables for easy updates and consistency across the project.\n",
    "- **Mixins for Reusable Code**: Create reusable pieces of code for things like buttons, forms, which can be included wherever needed.\n",
    "- **Extend/Inheritance**: Share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another, reducing the amount of code you need to write and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Features\n",
    "- **Control Directives**: Use if/else statements and for/each loops in your CSS, which are not possible in plain CSS.\n",
    "- **Built-in Functions**: SASS offers functions for color manipulation, mathematics and more, enhancing the functionality of CSS.\n",
    "- **Compatibility**: Automatically handles browser prefixing, ensuring that your styles work across different browsers without extra code."
