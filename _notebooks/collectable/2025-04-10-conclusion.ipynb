    "- Practice using **List**, **Set**, and **Deque**\n",
    "- Understand when and why to use each\n",
    "- Apply key methods from each collection type\n",
    "- Practice iteration and conditional logic with collections\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task:**  \n",
    "Create a method that takes a List<Integer> and returns a new list containing only the **even numbers**, in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Use ArrayList\n",
    "- Use add, get, and size\n",
    "- Use a loop (not streams)\n",

    "**Task:**  \n",
    "Create a method that takes two Set<String> objects and returns a new Set<String> with only the **common elements** (i.e. the intersection).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Use HashSet\n",
    "- Use contains, add, and iteration\n",
    "- Final result should have **no duplicates**\n",

    "1. Add 3 customers to the **end**\n",
    "2. Add 1 customer to the **front** (VIP)\n",
    "3. Remove the customer at the **front**\n",
    "4. Show the current front and back of the line\n",
    "5. Print the size of the line\n",
