As long as Docker Desktop and Docker App is running, you can make little changes and save, they should refresh in site within a few seconds.  ***Any errors, runtime errors, will appear in browser of VSCode terminal***, read messages thoroughly and debug errors.  Docker Desktop may consume a lot of CPU resources, if you are unplugged you may want to close it after you are done testing.\n",
