    "Congratulations for making it this far!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This is part two of College Board's Big Idea 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1 - Fundamentals (Previous unit)\n",
    "In the previous unit, you covered the foundational concepts of programming, including:\n",
    "- 3.1 Variables\n",
    "- 3.2 Data Abstraction\n",
    "- 3.3 Mathematical Expressions\n",
    "- 3.4 Strings\n",
    "- 3.5 Booleans\n",
    "- 3.6 Conditionals\n",
    "- 3.7 Nested Conditionals\n",
    "- 3.8 Iteration\n",
    "- 3.10 Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2 - Core Concepts (This unit)\n",
    "In this unit, you will delve into more complex topics, such as:\n",
    "- 3.9 Developing Algorithms\n",
    "- 3.11 Search\n",
    "- 3.12 Calling Procedures\n",
    "- 3.13 Developing Procedures and Procedural Abstraction\n",
    "- 3.14 Libraries\n",
    "- 3.15 Random Values\n",
    "- 3.16 Simulations\n",
    "- 3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency\n",
    "- 3.18 Undecidable Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it matters\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts will help you grow in coding style and proficiency. Mastering these topics will prepare you for coding in a system, rather than the simplicity of coding in a single code cell. This knowledge is crucial for developing more sophisticated and efficient programs, and it will be invaluable as you progress in your computer science journey."

    "## Continuing on next Topics\n",
    "In this unit, the topics are more complex and combine theory and programming. Provided are a few terms, but don't worry if you don't understand them at first as it is the purpose of the lesson to help you grow in the concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Terms\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: A measure of how well an algorithm performs, particularly in terms of time and space resources.\n",
    "- **Procedures**: A programming language structure that encapsulates a sequence of statements to perform a specific task. Often called a method, function, or subroutine.\n",
    "- **Libraries**: Collections of pre-written code that you can import into your programs to add functionality without having to write the code from scratch.\n",
    "- **Random Values**: Values generated by a process that cannot be predicted beforehand. Coding languages contain functions to create random numbers, which are useful in simulations and games.\n",
    "- **Simulations**: Algorithms designed to model the behavior of real-world systems or processes over time.\n",
    "- **Undecidable Problems**: Problems for which no algorithm can be constructed that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer.\n",
