    "## Instances of Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Java** is an **object-oriented programming language**, focusing on the manipulation of **objects**. **Objects** are a **reference type**, meaning they combine **primitive** and **reference data types**. When referenced, it points to their storage location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition of each object is defined by a **class**, which acts as a template. A **class** outlines what an object is and what it can do, similar to a **blueprint** for a house. Each house (object) built from this blueprint (class) may vary in appearance but shares common features and functions."

    "## Initializing Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an **object**, we call the object's **constructor**. Every **class** must have a constructor; if you don't create one, a default empty constructor is provided. If a **class** is like a blueprint, the **constructor** is the architect bringing it to life. The **constructor** takes in parameters (e.g., name, age) and assigns specific values to create the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Car(String brand, String model, int year)\n",
    "Car flash = new Car(\"BMW\", \"X7\", 2023);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an object is similar to creating a variable: start with the **type**, enter the object's **name**, and use the **equals sign** (assignment operator) to assign a value. Use the **new** keyword to create a new object. The order of parameters in the **constructor** matters; an **IllegalArgumentException** will arise if the order is incorrect. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** can have multiple **constructors** (overloading), differentiated by their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **null** keyword means no reference is created, and the object contains nothing:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Car lightning = null;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Be cautious with **null** objects, as calling a method on them results in a **NullPointerException**."

    "## Calling a Void Method\n",
    "\n",
    "A **method** consists of five main parts: **scope**, **return type**, **name**, **parameters**, and **body**. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void study(int hoursStudied) {\n",
    " totalHours += hoursStudied;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scope**: `public` - Anyone can access this method.\n",
    "2. **Return type**: `void` - The method returns nothing.\n",
    "3. **Name**: `study` - Case-sensitive.\n",
    "4. **Parameters**: `int hoursStudied` - Requires an integer input.\n",
    "5. **Body**: `totalHours += hoursStudied;` - The method's action.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be called on an object:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Person bob = new Person(\"bob\");\n",
    "bob.study(2);\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this snippet:\n",
    "- A new **Person** object named **bob** is created.\n",
    "- The `study` method is called on **bob** using **dot notation**.\n",
    "- `2` is passed as an argument, indicating bob studied for 2 hours."

    "## Calling a Void Method with Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**, like constructors, can be **overloaded**, meaning each method has a different parameter list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void waterTracker(int numberOfGlasses)\n",
    "public void waterTracker(String typeOfDrink)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `waterTracker` method is overloaded with two versions:\n",
    "1. Takes an **integer** parameter.\n",
    "2. Takes a **String** parameter.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Calling a Non-Void Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `study(int hoursStudied)` method, the return type was **void**, meaning nothing was returned. However, methods in Java can have various return types, both **primitive** and **reference types**. Methods can return types like **int**, **String**, **boolean**, **double**, **Object**, and more. Implementing a non-void return type allows storing the result for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method with a non-void return type must end with a **return statement**, specifying what the method returns. The return statement must be the last line in the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public double degreesToRadians(double degrees) {\n",
    " double radians = degrees * (3.141 / 180);\n",
    " return radians;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, the return type is **double**, so we return the variable **radians**. The result can be stored in a variable like this:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "double result = degreesToRadians(34.5);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The right side evaluates to approximately **0.602**, which becomes the value of **result**. Pretty useful!"

    "## String Objects: Concatenation, Literals, and More\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, a **String** object is a sequence of characters. You can create a **String** object using the **String class's constructor**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String greeting = new String(\"What's up?\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, the more efficient way is to use a **string literal**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String greeting = \"What's up?\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a **String** is an object, you can call methods on it, such as `.length()` and `.toLowerCase()`. One special feature of **Strings** is **string concatenation**, which combines two or more strings into a single string using the `+` operator. Remember to add a space between words, as Java does not do that automatically:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String greeting = \"What's \" + \"up?\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Escape characters** represent special characters in a string. For example, `\\n` represents a new line:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String greeting = \"Hello,\\nworld!\";\n",
    "```\n",

    "## String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, the **String** class has several methods for performing operations on strings. Some common **String** methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **length()**: Returns the length of the string.\n",
    "- **indexOf(String str)**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified string.\n",
    "- **substring(int beginIndex)**: Returns a new string that starts at the specified **beginIndex** and extends to the end of the string.\n",
    "- **substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)**: Returns a new string that starts at **beginIndex** and extends to **endIndex - 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **substring** method is overloaded with two versions. In Java, indexing starts at 0, meaning the first character of a string has an index of 0. For example, the string `\"taco cat\"` has a length of 8 characters, with indices from 0 to 7."

    "\n",
    "- **abs(int a)**: Returns the absolute value of the argument as an **int** or **double**, depending on the input type.\n",
