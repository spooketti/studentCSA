    "### Stack Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack memory is a region of memory that stores temporary variables created by each function (including the main function). It is managed by the execution stack and follows a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stores primitive data types and references to objects.\n",
    "- Memory is allocated in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.\n",
    "- Each thread has its own stack, ensuring thread safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int number = 100; // Stored in the stack\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stack Variables Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "College Board often asks questions about stack usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since primitives are always on the stack, they point directly to the content. This is best observed in a debugger.\n",
    "- A reference type contains an address to the content on the stack.\n",
    "- Passing a stack variable to a method creates a copy of the content of that variable.\n",
    "- Changes to the content of a primitive type will not return back to the method caller; this is called pass-by-value.\n",
    "- Since a reference type contains an address to the heap, the reference is copied when calling a method. This is called pass-by-reference, as data type changes are then performed according to the reference.\n"

    "### Heap Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap memory is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. It is managed by Java's memory management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used for storing objects and arrays.\n",
    "- Shared among all threads, requiring synchronization for thread safety.\n",
    "- Managed by the garbage collector, which reclaims memory when objects are no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Long form showing new\n",
    "String message = new String(\"Hello\");\n",
    "\n",
    "// Short form Java performs new find the scenes\n",
    "String message = \"Hello\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap Variables Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heap variables stay alive as long as a stack variable points to them.\n",
    "- By nature, all reference data types refer to an address on the stack but change content on the heap.\n",
    "- Objects created in the heap are globally accessible and can be shared among multiple methods, this creates concurrency issues when programming.\n",
    "- The garbage collector automatically reclaims memory from objects that are no longer referenced, helping to prevent memory leaks."
