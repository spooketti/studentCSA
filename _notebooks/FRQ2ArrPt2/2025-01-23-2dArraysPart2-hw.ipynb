    "Farmer John has a rectangular grass pasture with N rows and M columns for the cows to graze on. Each pasture has a certain tastiness value. However, the gen alpha Bessie has gotten quite picky with what she eats.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. getTotalGrass()\n",
    "- Return total sum of all \"tastiness values\" from the pastures in the 2D array\n",
    "2.  maxSquare()\n",
    "- Because Bessie sometimes likes enjoying square grass patches, she wants to find the best one.\n",
    "- Returns the maximum sum of tastiness value of a square in the 2D array. (Square could be 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc.) \n",
    "3. maxSubarraySum()\n",
    "- Sometimes, Bessie enjoys eating grass in a line.\n",
    "- Return the maximum sum of a continuous subarray in this array if it was \"flattened\" to be a 1D array. In other words, make the 2D array into a 1D array by combining all rows and find the max subarray sum.\n",
