    "- Returns the maximum sum of tastiness value of a square in the 2D array. (Square could be 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc.) \n",

    "- Sometimes, Bessie enjoys eating grass in a line.\n",
    "- Return the maximum sum of a continuous subarray in this array if it was \"flattened\" to be a 1D array. In other words, make the 2D array into a 1D array by combining all rows and find the max subarray sum.\n",
