# CollegeBoard Practice
On the AP Students page I completed the 2015 MCQ and FRQ practice to help study for the AP test coming up next month. 
## FRQ Reflection

I was happy with the solutions I derived and I felt that the FRQs were not too challenging in comparison to the MC. I liked that not all of the components of the FRQ needed to be implemented as I was able to just say "increase()" or "decrease()". One thing I did struggle however was the syntax. I understanded what I had to do fundamentally, but the syntax of java of the difference between length, length() and size() was confusing for me. I also felt anxoius to use any imported classes and so I tried to rely on the fundamentals of the language instead. It helped me get a better sense of the test format and the types of questions I might encounter. I now know which topics I need to review more to feel confident on test day.

## MC reflection

I did the 2020 MCQ and scored slightly worse than before. 28/40. Some reflection on the questions I got wrong are as follows. 
<ul>
<li>40: A, I misunderstood the line number meaning as A is looking for the super class of message, but it doesn't exist anymore.</li>
<li>26: C, There are m*n interations in 1 but m*n-m iterations in 2</li>
<li>23: D, The inner forloop is supposed to store the row of the 2d array in j whilst my answer does not</li>
<li>22: A: I thought the result was for if line 12 was executed once for each element in the array</li>
<li>16: C: I didn't realize the basecase was num==1 and not 0</li>
<li>14: I figured 1 keeps the rest of the run safe as it protects against if it is less than 0 but I suppose that was overthinking it </li>
<li>12: B, I thought C would work but the method call itself would return an error regardless of it is null</li>
<li>7: E, my answer would have failed in -100 exclusive 0 inclusive</li>
<li>6: A: only 1 works as the type cast is applied to 2 not the whole expression. </li>
<li>5: E: I did not realize it replaces an already existing constructor</li>
<li>4: D: I misread the call as (15,15,5)</li>
<li>3: C: I'm supposed to take the absolute value of the difference. </li>
</ul>
