| Beyond Perfunctory         |   1           |     .85      |         For reasons I'm not sure of my blog does not support the menu: in metadata,  so I developed my own navigation menu for the lessons that has its own styling and css to better fit my blog's theme.  I also wrote an extra notes page that I can fall back on in case i need to review a unit again. https://spooketti.github.io/studentCSA//2024/10/09/Sprint2_Recap.html ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342c0f53-818c-4ef0-bc99-3d62b7a59000) |
